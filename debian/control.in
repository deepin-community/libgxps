 a new electronic paper format originally developed by Microsoft and it serves
 as a PDF alternative. XPS files are usually created using "Microsoft XPS
 Document Writer" in Windows environments. It is now standardized as an open

 graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents
 of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which
 supports ZIP files.
 .
 The OpenXPS document format specification supports features such as color
 gradients, transparencies, CMYK color spaces, printer calibration,
